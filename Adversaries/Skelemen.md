# **`=this.file.name`**
**Magic infused remains.** Mana flows through all of Outer World’s living beings, and some claim it ‘gets in your bones’. 
The unsleep is a curse for those with ruthless ambition, the afflicted rise in an endless pursuit of power and riches.

**Vanglorious bones.** Skelemen are the re-animated remains of the greedy or
the criminally ambitious. Death is not the end for the excessively conniving.
> [!column] Traits

>> Old roads, tunnels or ruins where they can ambush passers-by.
>
>> [!metadata|text-Center bg-c-gray] Gear
>> Armed with a Standard or Quick Weapon that’s ravaged by time.
>
>> [!metadata|text-Center bg-c-gray] Communication
>> They cannot speak, so use mime and gesticulation instead. 
>> They understand Low Speech and any other languages they knew in their previous lives.
>
>> [!metadata|text-Center bg-c-gray] Tactics
>> They target the unsuspecting or solitary, working as group to ambush or distract. They will:
>> - Pretend to be normal corpses then suddenly spring into action at an opportune moment.
>> - Defend fallen allies in order to give them time to Self-Assemble.
>> - Try to take a hostage, to later carefully remove their eyes and tongue, for use in their transition into [[Skelemasters]].
>
>> [!metadata|text-Center bg-c-gray] Indicator
>> The sound of clacking bones, corpses with eyes and tongues removed, fresh blood on discarded weapons.
>
>> [!metadata|text-Center bg-c-gray] Roleplaying Notes
>> Prone to insulting or dramatic gestures. Amused by their own brilliance.

### Abilities
> [!column] Traits
>> [!metadata|text-Center bg-c-gray] Living Dead [B]
>> ---
>> Skelemen are not subject to the afflictions that plague the living.
>> - Immune to Fatigue, Starvation, Suffocation, and aging.
>> - Immune to toxins that target living tissue which are ingested, inhaled, or injected.
>> - Can only be animated when within 1 mile of the living creature ([[Bio-Mechanoid]]s do not count) or a [[Skelemonarch]]. 
>>   When out of range they are aware but inert.
>>  
>> **Adds 1 Dark Allegiance Point**
>
 >> [!metadata|text-Center bg-c-gray] Pull Yourself Together [B]
>> ---
>> You can’t keep an evil Skeleman down.
>> - When reduced to 0 Hearts, or less, their bones clatter to the ground; but over the next 3 Turns they will reform, all Hearts restored.\
>> - The GM may decide a crushing or obliterating attack prevents a Self-Assembly. Otherwise, you’ll need to take a Turn to shatter the skull to prevent reanimation.
>> 
>> **Adds 1 Dark Allegiance Point**

### Yield
> [!column] Loot!
>> [!metadata|text-Center bg-c-gray] Clacking Cranium
>> ---
>> A Skeleman’s skull remains animated even when the rest of it’s body is crushed. While it will try to be dangerous, gnashing it’s teeth pointlessly, it is a harmless novelty item.
>> - Inventory: 1 Slot
>> - Worth: 5 Coins

### Mood Table
>> [!metadata|text-Center bg-c-gray] **1-5** Preoccupied
>> The Skelemen are busy distributing the eyes and tongues of recent victims, one may still be bound and alive! They ignore the PC’s, unless provoked or annoyed.
>
>> [!metadata|text-Center bg-c-gray] **6-14** Embarrassed
>> The Skelemen are in the midst of setting up a trap or ambush. Awkward.
>
>> [!metadata|text-Center bg-c-gray] **15-20** Hateful
>> The Skelemen are aware of the PC’s approach, and haven’t had a chance to mix it up with the living for quite a while.
