# break-obsidian-templates
A Collection of Obsidian.md Templates for the TTRPG **BREAK!!**.
These are split into both templates and the databases that are used for tracking/generating from the template.

This is being updated and added to as I finish the templates and am happy with them.
Currently, there are only templates for Adversaries and a quick Dungeon based on the OnePageDungeon website. 

Plugins required are:
- Some version of the ITS Theme (https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme)
- DataView
- Templater

You'll need to setup the Database settings correctly and point each to the path that you want to save the newly generated 
note.
